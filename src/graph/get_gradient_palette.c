|		get_gradient_palette
|
|	Creates an array of colors (a palette) from another array of colors.
|
|	Colors are in 0xrrggbb form, transparency is ignored.
|
|	Takes in :
|		- colors		the base array of colors
|		- color_count	the size of that array
|		- size			the size of the new array
|
|	Each color of the base colors array is compared to the next one in
|		order to create a new intermediate color.
|
|	This is done over and over again to create gradients between each
|		pair of colors in the base colors array.
|
|	A pair of colors is always colors[i] and colors[i + 1], so the base
|		colors array cannot contain less than 2 colors.
|
|	Method and arithmetic for building the new palette :
|
|	- Our palette of [size] will be divided in sections of gradients
|		between pairs of colors
|	- Since we have [color_count] colors, we have [color_count] - 1 sections
|		SECTIONS = color_count - 1
|	- Each of these sections will take [size] / SECTIONS slots
|		SLOTS = size / (color_count - 1)
|		this number is a rational and not an integer, this will be resolved
|	- The number of slots each section takes is the number of different
|		colors present in each color-pair gradient
|	- Gradients use a ratio starting at 0 and ending at 1, so the amount by
|		which to increment our gradient ratio is 1 / SLOTS
|		RATIO_STEP = 1 / (size / (color_count - 1))
|	- If [size] is not a multiple of [color_count - 1], RATIO_STEP will not
|		add up nicely to 1, you might get 0.8 followed by 1.1, and a way to
|		resolve this nicely is to carry over this ratio - 1 difference to the
|		next color-pair ratio.
|	- Hence, ratio is continuous over all the color pairs.
|	- The last problem to resolve is how to start and end our palette
|		- We can start and end our palette with 0 and 1
|			Ex: 000000 808080 ffffff
|				0.00   0.50   1.00
|		- We can start and end with mid-values
|			Ex: 404040 808080 bfbfbf
|				0.25   0.50   0.75
|	- For the former, we simply start at 0 and substract 1 to [size]
|		RATIO_STEP = 1 / (size - 1 / (color_count - 1))
|	- For the latter, we start at an already incremented ratio and add 1
|		RATIO_STEP = 1 / (size + 1 / (color_count - 1))
|
|	It is up to the parent function to free the allocated palette correctly
